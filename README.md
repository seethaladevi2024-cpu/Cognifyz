📌 Java Internship Tasks – Cognifyz Technologies

This repository contains Java programs developed as part of the Software Development Internship at Cognifyz Technologies.
The tasks progress from beginner to intermediate level and focus on strengthening core Java concepts through practical implementation.

🏢 Internship Details

Organization: Cognifyz Technologies

Domain: Software Development

Programming Language: Java

Mode: Console-based Applications

📂 Tasks Overview
🔹 Level 1 – Beginner
✅ Task 1: Text-Based Game

Description:
A simple number guessing game developed using Java. The program uses conditional statements to determine whether the user’s guess is correct, too high, or too low.

Key Concepts Used:

Conditional statements (if, else if, else)

User input using Scanner

Basic game logic

✅ Task 2: Number Pattern Generation

Description:
A Java program that generates and prints number patterns (pyramid style) using nested loops.

Sample Output:

1
12
123
1234


Key Concepts Used:

for loops

Nested loops

Pattern logic

🔹 Level 2 – Intermediate
✅ Task 3: Task Manager (CRUD Application)

Description:
A console-based Task Manager application that performs Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on a list of tasks using ArrayList.

Features:

Add new tasks

View all tasks

Update task details

Delete tasks

Key Concepts Used:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Classes and objects

ArrayList

Menu-driven program

✅ Task 4: Temperature Converter

Description:
A Java program that converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit, allowing users to choose the conversion direction.

Conversion Formulas:

Celsius → Fahrenheit: (C × 9/5) + 32

Fahrenheit → Celsius: (F − 32) × 5/9

Key Concepts Used:

Conditional logic

Mathematical operations

User input handling

▶️ How to Run the Programs

Install Java JDK (8 or above)

Open the project folder in VS Code

Compile the program:

javac FileName.java


Run the program:

java FileName

🧪 Testing

Each program has been tested with:

Valid inputs

Invalid inputs

Edge cases where applicable

🎯 Learning Outcomes

Strong understanding of core Java concepts

Hands-on experience with loops, conditionals, and OOP

Ability to build menu-driven console applications

Improved problem-solving and debugging skills

🙏 Acknowledgement

I would like to thank Cognifyz Technologies for providing this opportunity to learn and implement Java programming concepts through structured tasks.
